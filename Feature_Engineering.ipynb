        "1. What is a parameter?\n",
        "In the context of machine learning, a parameter is a variable that the model learns from the training data. Parameters are the coefficients or weights that the model adjusts during training to minimize the error in predictions. For example, in a linear regression model, the slope and intercept are parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is correlation?\n",
        "Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. It is quantified by the correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        " What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. For example, there may be a negative correlation between the amount of time spent studying and the number of errors made on a test; as study time increases, errors may decrease.\n",

        "3.  Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "Main components of Machine Learning include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Data: The foundation of ML, consisting of features (input variables) and labels (output variables).\n",
        "Algorithms: The mathematical models used to learn from data (e.g., linear regression, decision trees).\n",
        "Model: The output of the training process, which represents learned patterns.\n",
        "Training: The process of feeding data into the algorithm to learn the model.\n",

        "4.How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "The loss value quantifies how well the model's predictions align with the actual outcomes. A lower loss value indicates better performance, meaning the model's predictions are closer to the true values. By monitoring the loss during training, you can determine if the model is learning effectively or if it is overfitting or underfitting the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "Continuous Variables: Numerical variables that can take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight, temperature).\n",

        "Binary Encoding: Combines the benefits of one-hot and label encoding by converting categories into binary numbers.\n",
        "Target Encoding: Replaces categories with the mean of the target variable for that category, useful for high-cardinality categorical variables.\n",

        "Training Dataset: The subset of data used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships from this data.\n",
