        "\n",
        "The mathematical equation of Logistic Regression is given by:\n",
        "\n",
        "[ P(Y=1|X) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + ... + \\beta_nX_n)}} ]\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "\n",
        "( P(Y=1|X) ) is the probability that the output ( Y ) is 1 given input features ( X ).\n",
        "( \\beta_0 ) is the intercept.\n",
        "( \\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_n ) are the coefficients for the features ( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n ).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Why do we use the Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Sigmoid function is used in Logistic Regression because it maps any real-valued number into the range (0, 1), making it suitable for modeling probabilities. It ensures that the predicted probabilities are bounded between 0 and 1, which is essential for binary classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the cost function of Logistic Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "The cost function for Logistic Regression is the Log Loss (or Binary Cross-Entropy Loss), defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "[ J(\\beta) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} [y^{(i)} \\log(h_\\beta(x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \\log(1 - h_\\beta(x^{(i)}))] ]\n",

        "\n",
        "4, What is Regularization in Logistic Regression? Why is it needed?\n",
        "\n",
        "Regularization in Logistic Regression is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function. It helps to constrain the model complexity by discouraging large coefficients. Regularization is needed to improve the model's generalization to unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Explain the difference between Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization): Adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. It can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing variable selection.\n",
        "Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization): Adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. It shrinks coefficients but does not set them to zero, thus retaining all features.\n",
        "Elastic Net: Combines both L1 and L2 penalties. It is useful when there are multiple features correlated with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. When should we use Elastic Net instead of Lasso or Ridge?\n",
        "\n",
        "Elastic Net should be used when there are multiple features that are correlated with each other, as it can select groups of correlated features. It is also beneficial when the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations, as it can provide a more stable solution than Lasso or Ridge alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the impact of the regularization parameter (λ) in Logistic Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "The regularization parameter ( \\lambda ) controls the strength of the penalty applied to the coefficients. A larger ( \\lambda ) increases the penalty, leading to smaller coefficients and potentially higher bias but lower variance. Conversely, a smaller ( \\lambda ) allows for larger coefficients, which can lead to overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are the key assumptions of Logistic Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "The key assumptions of Logistic Regression include:\n",
        "The dependent variable is binary.\n",
        "The observations are independent.\n",
        "There is a linear relationship between the logit of the outcome and the independent variables.\n",
        "No multicollinearity among the independent variables.\n",

        "\n",
        "11. How does class imbalance affect Logistic Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Class imbalance can lead to biased predictions, where the model may favor the majority class , resulting in poor performance on the minority class. This can cause the model to achieve high accuracy while failing to correctly classify instances of the minority class. Techniques such as resampling, using different evaluation metrics, or applying cost-sensitive learning can help address this issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is Hyperparameter Tuning in Logistic Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Hyperparameter tuning in Logistic Regression involves optimizing the parameters that are not learned from the data during training, such as the regularization parameter ( \\lambda ) and the choice of solver. This process aims to improve the model's performance by finding the best combination of hyperparameters through techniques like grid search or random search.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What are different solvers in Logistic Regression? Which one should be used?\n",
        "Different solvers for Logistic Regression include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Liblinear: Good for small datasets and supports L1 regularization.\n",
        "Newton's Method: Fast convergence but may not work well with large datasets.\n",
        "LBFGS: A quasi-Newton method that is efficient for large datasets.\n",
        "SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent): Suitable for large datasets and online learning.\n",
        "The choice of solver depends on the dataset size and the need for regularization.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How is Logistic Regression extended for multiclass classification?\n",
        "\n",
        "Logistic Regression can be extended for multiclass classification using techniques like One-vs-Rest (OvR) or Softmax Regression. In OvR, a separate binary classifier is trained for each class, while Softmax Regression generalizes the logistic function to multiple classes by using the softmax function to output probabilities for each class.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Logistic Regression?\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple and easy to implement.\n",
        "Interpretable coefficients.\n",
        "Works well with linearly separable data.\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "Assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the logit of the outcome.\n",
        "Sensitive to outliers.\n",
        "Limited to binary outcomes unless extended for multiclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are some use cases of Logistic Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Use cases of Logistic Regression include:\n",
        "Medical diagnosis (e.g., predicting the presence of a disease).\n",
        "Credit scoring (e.g., determining the likelihood of default).\n",
        "Marketing response prediction (e.g., whether a customer will respond to a campaign).\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What is the difference between Softmax Regression and Logistic Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Softmax Regression is an extension of Logistic Regression for multiclass classification. While Logistic Regression predicts probabilities for two classes, Softmax Regression predicts probabilities for multiple classes by normalizing the output scores across all classes, ensuring that they sum to one.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. How do we choose between One-vs-Rest (OvR) and Softmax for multiclass classification?\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice between OvR and Softmax depends on the problem context. OvR is often preferred when the classes are imbalanced or when interpretability of individual binary classifiers is desired. Softmax is more suitable when the classes are mutually exclusive and when a single model is preferred for efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. How do we interpret coefficients in Logistic Regression?\n",
        "In Logistic Regression, the coefficients represent the change in the log odds of the outcome for a one-unit increase in the predictor variable, holding all other variables constant. A positive coefficient indicates an increase in the probability of the outcome, while a negative coefficient indicates a decrease.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is Logistic Regression, and how does it differ from Linear Regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the outcome variable is categorical, typically taking on two values (e.g., 0 or 1, yes or no). It models the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class. The output of Logistic Regression is a probability value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the likelihood of the positive class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Differences between Logistic Regression and Linear Regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "Nature of the Dependent Variable:\n",
        "\n",
        "Logistic Regression: Used for binary or categorical outcomes. The dependent variable is categorical (e.g., success/failure, yes/no).\n",
        "Linear Regression: Used for continuous outcomes. The dependent variable is continuous (e.g., height, weight, price).\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "Logistic Regression: Outputs probabilities that are transformed using the logistic (sigmoid) function, ensuring that the predicted values lie between 0 and 1.\n",
        "Linear Regression: Outputs a continuous value, which can take any real number.\n",
        "Mathematical Model:\n",
        "\n",
        "Logistic Regression: Uses the logistic function to model the relationship between the independent variables and the probability of the dependent variable being 1. The model is expressed as: [ P(Y=1|X) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + ... + \\beta_nX_n)}} ]\n",
        "Linear Regression: Models the relationship as a linear equation: [ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + ... + \\beta_nX_n + \\epsilon ] where ( \\epsilon ) is the error term.\n",

        "\n",
        "Logistic Regression: Uses the Log Loss (or Binary Cross-Entropy Loss) as the cost function to measure the performance of the model.\n",
