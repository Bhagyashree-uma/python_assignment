        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as an object. Encapsulation helps to restrict direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. It promotes modularity and helps in maintaining the integrity of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It allows programmers to focus on interactions at a higher level without needing to understand all the details of the implementation. Abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class (the subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (the superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, allowing for the creation of more specific classes based on general ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). The two types of polymorphism are compile-time (or static) polymorphism, achieved through method overloading, and runtime (or dynamic) polymorphism, achieved through method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition: Composition is a design principle that models a \"has-a\" relationship. It involves building complex types by combining objects of other types. This allows for more flexible and maintainable code, as the composed objects can be reused in different contexts without inheritance."
